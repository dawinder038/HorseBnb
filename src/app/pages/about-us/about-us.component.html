                    <p  style="font-size: 14px;" >HorseBnB was created by horse owners for horse owners and <br> horse enthusiasts. The goal of
                        HorseBnB is
                        to simplify all aspects <br> of horse ownership. We have seen the need for a platform of this <br>
                        type for a
                        long time. After years and years of being on the road <br> with our horses, we realized there has to
                        be a
                        better way to <br> connect horse people with other horse people.</p>

                <div>
                    <p  style="font-size: 14px;" >  HorseBnB is the first platform that allows everyone in the horse <br> world to easily connect with
                        one
                        another. We at HorseBnB want <br> everyone who has a horse or a barn to have this App on their <br>
                        phone. We
                        provide solutions for long term <br> board, short term stays, and horse activities. This is just the
                        beginning for HorseBnB. <br> We have great plans of expanding HorseBnB to simplify all other <br>
                        aspects of horse
                        ownership in the future.

                        YOU! If you love the HorseBnB <br> website and App, spread the word to your fellow horse friends <br> and
                        horse family members. The more users HorseBnB has, the <br>  bigger and better the community will be.
